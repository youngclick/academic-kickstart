Memphis Heat Watch was conducted as one of eight selected cities under NOAA's Center for Collaborative Heat Monitoring (CCHM). The project mapped neighborhood-scale heat conditions and produced actionable insights for local adaptation and mitigation planning.

- **Period:** Mar–Dec 2025  
- **Award:** $10,000  
- **Role:** Principal Investigator  
- **Partners:** City of Memphis, The Works, community volunteers

The campaign generated high-value datasets linking land surface temperature, ambient temperature, and canopy structure, supporting ongoing manuscript development and follow-up collaborations.
