The main goal of this project is to compute magnitudes and spatial distribution of stresses responsible for earthquakes occurring in regions far from plate boundaries based on seismically imaged heterogeneities in mantle and known geological structures like layers of different kinds of rock or major fault zones. Computed stress distributions can be compared with the observed seismicity. The study area we have been working on include the New Madrid Seismic Zone in the central US, the Charlesvoix Seismic Zone in eastern Canada and the Korean peninsular.

The impact crater and Paleozoic rift faults together increases differential stress in the areas of high seismicity. For more details, see [(Fadugba et al., JGR, 2019)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB017831)" >}}

The upper mantle heterogeneities clearly contribute to differerntial stresses in the known seismic zones. Discrepancy between the predicted and the observed faulting styles are attributed to stress sources not included in this study. This work is in review for publication in Geophys. J. Int." >}}
